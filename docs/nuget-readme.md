# Intellenum - Intelligent Enum Generator

# What is the package?

This is a a Source Generator to generate intelligent enums. [TODO] add more

The main goal is that the intelligent enums have almost the same speed and memory performance as using primitive enums and have much faster lookups.

```csharp
[Intellenum<int>]
[Member("One", 1)]
public partial struct Numbers 
{
}
```
